# Overview

c16b64 is a compiler for 16b64 code.

After several failed attempts and lack of motivation for learning LLVM IR, a decision was made to have the compiler generate valid Rust code, and using the Rust compiler to produce the final binary.

## Setup

### Compiler

To compile 16b64 code you need the compiler.

To compile the 16b64 compiler:

`cargo build --release`

Alternatively get the binary, if listed in the releases tab.

Put the binary generated by this in the folder you'd like to work in, or alternatively $PATH

## Dependencies

You will need `rustc` to compile the binary, which should already be installed if `cargo` is installed
