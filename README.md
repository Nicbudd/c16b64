# Overview

This is my attempt at writing a x86 (x64?) Linux compiler for 16b64 (in Rust).

I've never written a compiler before and I just wrote my first Hello World in ASM a few minutes ago.

So help me God. 

## Setup

### Compiler

To compile 16b64 code you need the compiler.

To compile the 16b64 compiler:

`cargo build --release`

Alternatively get the binary, if listed in the releases tab.

Put the binary generated by this in the folder you'd like to work in, or alternatively $PATH

## Dependencies

You will need `gcc` and 32 bit dev libraries for gcc (for now)

### Ubuntu / Debian (untested)

`sudo apt install gcc libc6-dev-i386`

### Fedora

`sudo dnf install gcc libgcc.i686 glibc-devel.i686`

## Compiling with the compiler

Hopefully at some point I will simply make this process more streamlined, but here's the instructions for now (the name of the file you wish to compile (before the .16b) is written as `<FILE>`):

`c16b64 <FILE>.16b` 

`gcc -m32 <FILE>.s -o <FILE>`

To run:

`./<FILE>`
